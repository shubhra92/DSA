> ## Problem Statement

A printing press in DiceCity uses a special machine to print colors on blank sheets of paper. The machine operates on pairs of neighboring sheets and can print in one of two color combinations:

- "BR": Changes two neighboring blank sheets to blue (B) and red (R).
- "RB": Changes two neighboring blank sheets to red (R) and blue (B).

Each operation of the machine modifies the colors of the two adjacent sheets beneath it.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the sequence that is to be printed.

The second line of each test case contains a string s denoting the sequence of colors that is to be printed on the sheets. It is guaranteed that the length of s is N and that s only consists of the characters W, R, and B.
```

> ## Output Format
```
For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the target sequence can be printed, or "NO" if it cannot be.
```

> ## Constraints
```
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
2
3
RBR
1
B
```
**Testcase Output**
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**

Testcase 1: The sequence "RBB" can be achieved as follows:
Print "RB" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: RBW
Print "BR" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: RBR

Testcase 2: It is impossible to achieve a single "B" starting from all white sheets using the machine as it requires at least one "R" for the machine to print "B".

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
2
5
BRBBW
3
BRB
```
**Testcase Output**
```
YES
YES
```
**Explanation**

Testcase 1: Starting with all sheets as 'W', the sequence "BRBBW" can be achieved by printing the machine in the following steps:


Print "BR" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: BRWWW
Print "RB" on sheets 3 and 4 → Result: BRRBW
Print "RB" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: BRBBW

Testcase 2: The sequence "BRB" can be achieved by printing the machine as follows:


Print "BR" on sheets 1 and 2 → Result: BRW
Print "RB" on sheets 2 and 3 → Result: BRB
