> ## Problem Statement

Vikas needs help solving a puzzle where he must find which words can be formed using the characters from a given string.
You are given an array of strings W with N elements and a string C. A word is considered "good" if it can be formed using the characters from C, with each character in C being used at most once.
Your task is to calculate and return the sum of the lengths of all the "good" strings in the array W.

> ## Input Format
```
The first line contains an integer N, representing the length of the array W.
The next N line takes a single string representing the element of array W.
The last line contains the single string C, representing the character string.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Print the sum of the lengths of all the good strings in the words.

```

> ## Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= W[i].length, C.length <= 10^2

```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
5
abc
bce
mcb
nab
omn
zklac
```
**Testcase Output**
```

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
10
cmkkm
uqguo
ilgpk
ovjad
cyzpx
tptjk
uhyta
qarhb
sqaed
fdfdf
ovjadqguoqarhb
```
**Testcase Output**
```
10
```
**Explanation**

WIth the characters in "ovjadqguoqarhb" we can form the strings:


1) "ovjad" of length 5 as all character of string appear in string C
2) "qarhb" of length 5 as all character of string appear in string C

Therefore, the sum of total length is 5 + 5 = 10
