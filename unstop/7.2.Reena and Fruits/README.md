> ## Problem Statement

Reena has a basket containing an array of 2N fruits.

- She needs to pair these fruits into N pairs, (a1, b1) , (a2, b2),.....,(an, bn), such that the sum of the minimum values in each pair, min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized.

Your task is to calculate and print this maximum possible sum.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line contains a single even integer representing the number of fruits, 2N.

The second line contains 2N space-separated integers representing the fruits.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Print a single integer, which is the maximum sum.
```

> ## Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 10^5

length == 2 * N

-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
6
5 3 2 1 6 3
```
**Testcase Output**
```
9
```
**Explanation**

As to get maximum sum in this case our answer would be
Min(1,2) + min(3,3) + min(5,6) = 9

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
8
5 7 6 2 9 1 1 4
```
**Testcase Output**
```
15
```
**Explanation**

As to get maximum sum in this case our answer would be
Min(1,1) + min(2,4) + min(5,6) + min(7,9) = 15
