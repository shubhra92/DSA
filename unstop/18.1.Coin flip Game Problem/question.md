> ## Problem Statement

You have M coins placed on the floor, all initially showing tails.

- In the first round, you flip all the coins to heads.
- In the second round, you flip every second coin that is currently showing heads, turning it to tails.
- In the third round, you flip every third coin, toggling it between heads and tails.
- In the ith round, you flip every ith coin.
After performing this for M rounds, where in the last round you only flip the Mth coin, determine how many coins are showing heads.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line contains an integer M representing the number of coins.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Print the number of coins that are showing heads after M rounds.

```

> ## Constraints
```
0 <= M <= 10^4

```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
3
```
**Testcase Output**
```
1
```
**Explanation**

At first, the three Coins are [tail, tail, tail].


After the first round, the three Coins are [head, head, head].


After the second round, the three Coins are [head, tail, head].


After the third round, the three Coins are [head, tail, tail]. 


So you should Print 1 because there is only one Coin left with the head.
