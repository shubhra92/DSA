> ## Problem Statement

Mohan gave Rohan a challenge. Mohan said “I will give you a number N. You have to convert each number from 1 to N into binary form (1's and 0's). Then, calculate the total number of occurence of 1 in those converted numbers.”

Rohan asks for your help in achieving this.


> ## Input Format
```
You are given the integer N.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Display a single integer which is the count of occurrences of '1' in the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to ( N ).
```

> ## Constraints
```
0 < N<= 10^7
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
4
```
**Testcase Output**
```
5
```
**Explanation**

for (1) => (0001), set bits = 1


for (2) => (0010), set bits = 1


for (3) => (0011), set bits = 2


for (4) => (0100), set bits = 1


Total set bits = 5


Therefore, for N = 4, result is 5

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
5
```
**Testcase Output**
```
7
```
**Explanation**

Let input N = 5 then we have to count total set bits in digit 1 to 5,

for (1) => (0001), set bits = 1


for (2) => (0010), set bits = 1


for (3) => (0011), set bits = 2


for (4) => (0100), set bits = 1


for (5) => (0101), set bits = 2


Total set bits = 7


Therefore, for N = 5, result is 7
