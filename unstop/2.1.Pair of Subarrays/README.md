> ## Problem Statement

You are given an array A of size N.

Your task is to count the number of unique pairs of non-overlapping subarrays such that both subarrays have the same sum.

Each subarray is defined by a pair of indices [L, R] (1-based indexing), where 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N.

Two subarrays must not overlap, meaning they should not share any common index.

Also, the pair ([L1, R1], [L2, R2]) is considered the same as ([L2, R2], [L1, R1]), so count each valid pair only once.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the array size.

The second line of input contain N space-separated integers,representing the elements of array A.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Display a single integer representing the required number of pairs.
```

> ## Constraints
```
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

-10^6 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6
```

> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
4
1 -1 2 -2
```
**Testcase Output**
```
2
```
**Explanation**

The array is [1, -1, 2, -2].
There are two pairs of subarrays with equal sums that do not overlap:
Subarray from index 1 to 2: [1, -1] with sum 1 - 1 = 0
Subarray from index 3 to 4: [2, -2] with sum 2 - 2 = 0
Subarray from index 1 to 1: [1] with sum 1
Subarray from index 2 to 3: [-1, 2] with sum -1 + 2 = 1
Therefore, the output is 2.

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Testcase Output**
```
1
```
**Explanation**

The array is [1, 2, 3].
There is only one pair of subarrays with equal sums that do not overlap:
Subarray from index 1 to 2: [1, 2] with sum 1 + 2 = 3
Subarray from index 3 to 3: [3] with sum 3
Therefore, the output is 1.
