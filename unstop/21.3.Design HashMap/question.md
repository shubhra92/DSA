> ## Problem Statement

Bob, in a fit of anger, vowed to avoid using built-in libraries after an argument with a programming language developer. He's attempting to create his own functions and data structures but got stuck while implementing a HashMap to map unique integer keys to integer values.
He needs help to perform three basic operations:

1. Insert: Add or update a (key, value) pair.
2. Get: Print the value for a given key, or -1 if the key doesn't exist.
3. Delete: Remove a key and its corresponding value if present.

Let's assist Bob in building his own HashMap without relying on any pre-existing hash table libraries.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line of the input contains N, the number of queries.
Each of the next n lines starts with integer T, the type of query.
For type = 1, the line further contains 2 integers denoting the key and its corresponding value to be inserted.
For type = 2, the line further contains a single integer denoting the key whose value is to be printed.
For type = 3, the line further contains a single integer denoting the key that is to be deleted.
```

> ## Output Format
```
For queries of type 2, print a single integer – value corresponding to the given key.

```

> ## Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 104
0 <= key, value <= 10^6
All the queries are orderly dependent.
There will be at least one type 2 query.
In type 3 queries, it is guaranteed that the key given is present in the map at the moment.

> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
8
1 1 1
1 2 2
2 1
2 3
1 2 1
2 2
3 2
2 2
```
**Testcase Output**
```
1
-1
1
-1
```
**Explanation**

For query 1, we insert (1, 1). Our map is now [(1, 1)]
For query 2, we insert (2, 2). Our map is now [(1, 1), (2, 2)]
For query 3, we print value corresponding to key 1, i.e., 1
For query 4, we do not have the key 3 in our map, hence we print -1
For query 5, we update the value corresponding to key 2 to 1. Out map now is [(1, 1), (2, 1)]
For query 6, we print the value corresponding to key 2, i.e., 1
For query 7, we delete the key 2 from the map. Out map now is [(1, 1)]
For query 8. we do not have the key 2 in our map anymore, hence we print -1

**Testcase Input**
```
9
1 4 2
1 25 6
2 4
1 4 8
2 25
3 25
2 25
1 25 1
2 25
```
**Testcase Output**
```
2
6
-1
1
```
**Explanation**

For query 1, we insert (4, 2). Our map is now [(4, 2)]
For query 2, we insert (25, 6). Our map is now [(4, 2), (25, 6)]
For query 3, we print value corresponding to key 4, i.e., 2
For query 4, we update the value corresponding to key 4 to 8. Out map now is [(4, 8), (25, 6)]
For query 5, we print the value corresponding to key 25, i.e., 6
For query 6, we delete the key 25 from the map. Out map now is [(4, 8)]
For query 7, we do not have the key 25 in our map anymore, hence we print -1
For query 8. we insert (25, 1). Our map is now [(4, 8), (25, 1)]
For query 9, we print the value corresponding to key 25, i.e., 1
