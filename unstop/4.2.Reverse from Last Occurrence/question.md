> ## Problem Statement

We are given a string s consisting of only lowercase letters of english, and a character ch.

Your task is to reverse a portion of a string from the last occurrence of a given character ch to the end of the string.



> ## Input Format
```
First line contains a string s and character ch.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Print the transformed string.
```

> ## Constraints
```
1<=|s.length|<=10^5
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
abc c
```
**Testcase Output**
```
abc
```
**Explanation**

Last occurrence of c is the last character of the string, so reversing it won’t change the string.

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
abxcced c
```
**Testcase Output**
```
abxcdec
```
**Explanation**

The last index of 'c' occurring is:4. Reversing the string from 4th index to last: "ced" to "dec". 
The final string therefore is: "abxcdec".
