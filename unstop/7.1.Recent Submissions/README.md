> ## Problem Statement

Steve is participating in competitive coding.

- Whenever he makes a submission at time 't', any submission made exactly 5000 seconds before 't' is removed from the queue.

Given N submissions, where each submission is associated with a distinct time 't', determine the maximum size of the submission queue at any point in time after all 'N submissions.

Note: It is guaranteed that every submission uses a strictly larger value of ‘t’ than the previous submission.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line of input contains an integer N representing the size of array which is number of submissions.

The second line contains N space separated integers representing the array arr which contains the timestamps of each submission.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Print an integer in a single line containing the maximum size possible.
```

> ## Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
3 
300 6000 100000
```
**Testcase Output**
```
1
```
**Explanation**

Steve makes 3 submissions at the following times: 300, 6000, and 100000 seconds. In this scenario, each submission at time 't' results in the removal of the previous submission made exactly 5000 seconds before 't'.

After all submissions:


      At time 300, the queue contains submissions: [300]. Size of queue: 1.


      At time 6000, the submission made at time 300 (which was 5000 seconds before this submission) is removed. Queue now: [6000]. Size of queue: 1.


      At time 100000, the submission made at time 6000 (which was 5000 seconds before this submission) is removed. Queue now: [100000]. Size of queue: 1.


Therefore, the maximum size of the submission queue observed at any point after all submissions is 1.

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
4
1 100 5000 5002
```
**Testcase Output**
```
3
```
**Explanation**

Steve makes 4 submissions at the following times: 1, 100, 5000, and 5002 seconds. The submission queue behaves such that whenever a submission is made at time 't', any submission made exactly 5000 seconds before 't' is removed from the queue.


After all submissions:


      At time 1, the queue contains submissions: [1]. Size of queue: 1.


      At time 100, the queue contains submissions: [1, 100]. Size of queue: 2.


      At time 5000, the submission made at time 1 (which was 5000 seconds before this submission) is removed. Queue now: [100, 5000]. Size of queue: 2.


      At time 5002, the queue contains submissions: [100, 5000, 5002]. Size of queue: 3.


Thus, the maximum size of the submission queue observed at any point after all submissions is 3.
