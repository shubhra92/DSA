> ## Problem Statement

Team A has set a target of N-1 runs. Team B's goal is to score exactly N-1 runs to win. You are being given an array of length N, where each element represents the maximum number of runs Team B can score on that particular ball.

- Team B will play one ball at a time and can score anywhere between 0 and the value given in the array for that ball.
- The total number of balls Team B plays will equal the total number of runs they score.
- Starting from the first ball (index 0), your task is to determine if Team B can score exactly N-1 runs by selecting appropriate runs from each ball.
You need to return true if Team B can score exactly N-1 runs, or false if it is not possible.


> ## Input Format
```
The first line of input should be a single integer N representing the length of the array.

The second line of input should contain N space-separated integer a1, a2, a3.... aN where ai value represents the maximum run team B can score on ith ball.
```

> ## Output Format
```
Output a single Boolean value (true or false):

- true: If it's possible for Team B to score exactly N-1 runs.
- false: If it's not possible to reach the target.

```

> ## Constraints
```
1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
5
3 2 2 1 4
```
**Testcase Output**
```
true
```
**Explanation**

Array: [3, 2, 2, 1, 4]
Target: Team B needs to score 4 runs.


On the 0th ball, Team B can score up to 3 runs. Suppose they score 1 run and move to the 1st ball.
On the 1st ball, they can score up to 2 runs. Suppose they score 2 runs, bringing the total score to 3 and move to the 3rd ball.
From there, they can score exactly 1 run, bringing the total to 4, which is exactly what they need to win.
Hence, the answer is true.

> ## Sample Testcase 1

**Testcase Input**
```
5
3 2 1 0 4
```
**Testcase Output**
```
false
```
**Explanation**

Array: [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
Target: Team B needs to score 4 runs.


On the 0th ball, Team B can score up to 3 runs. They might score, say, 2 runs and move to the 2nd ball.
From the 2nd ball, they can score a maximum of 1 run, bringing the total score to 3, but they get stuck at the 3rd ball where 0 runs can be scored.
As a result, it's impossible to reach exactly 4 runs, so the answer is false.
