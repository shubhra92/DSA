> ## Problem Statement

In a school the class strength is represented as per following

Eg: if a[2]=20. The number of students in class 2 is 20, here 2 is the class_id.

Your task is to print X, the class_id of the first class with the number of students greater than or equal to the number of students in adjacent previous classes and also greater than or equal to the number of students in the adjacent class after it.

Print the value of X.

Note : - The array is 0 index-based.




> ## Input Format
```
In the first line, you are given an integer, n, denoting the size of the array

In the second line, you are given n-spaced integers denoting the array.
```

> ## Output Format
```
An integer value will be displayed representing X.
```

> ## Constraints
```
3 <= arr.length <= 10^4
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
```


> ## Sample Testcase 0

**Testcase Input**
```
3
